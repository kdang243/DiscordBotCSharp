# DiscordBotCSharp
A bot for a discord server that has a variety of commands for users to use.


Here's a simple discord bot that I made using c#. It's purpose is simply to provide discord members with interactive commands that might be useful. For example, it has an annoy command that spams another user for a brief second, it has simple calculator functions and it has commands regarding the weather. It currently uses the Open Weather Map API for it's weather commands (provides the user in a discord channel with information regarding the weather in any given city in the world).

The code right now will not run as I've removed the discord bot's token and the api's key for safety.
I will try to update the bot every now and then with random commands that I think would be useful for a user.
